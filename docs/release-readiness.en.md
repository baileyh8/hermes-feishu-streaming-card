# Release Readiness

[中文](release-readiness.md) | [English](release-readiness.en.md)

Current package version: `3.1.0`. This release is the formal sidecar-only mainline release and adds the ordinary-user `setup` installer. It has completed real Hermes Gateway + real Feishu test app acceptance and is suitable for formal installation and small-scale production use.

## Ready

- Hermes `v2026.4.23+` detection and fail-closed installation.
- Minimal Hermes hook, backup, manifest, restore, and uninstall.
- Sidecar `/events`, `/health`, and process `start/status/stop`.
- Feishu CardKit HTTP client, covered by mock Feishu server and real Feishu test app for tenant token, send, and update flows.
- Manual `smoke-feishu-card` command.
- E2E preview artifacts and generator.
- Real long-card stress test: one Feishu card updated to 16k Chinese characters.
- Real Hermes `v2026.4.23` `restore -> install` loop verification.
- GitHub Actions Python 3.9 / 3.12 test matrix for PRs and pushes.

## Required Pre-release Checks

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

Real Feishu integration must use local config or environment variables for `FEISHU_APP_ID` and `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`. Do not commit App Secret, tenant token, real chat_id, or sensitive screenshots. Public screenshots must be checked for secrets and private conversation content before being added to the repository.

## Current Boundaries

Automated tests do not access real Feishu and do not start a real Hermes Gateway. Real integration remains a local/manual acceptance flow. After successful testing, record only redacted results; never commit credentials, real chat_id, or sensitive screenshots.
